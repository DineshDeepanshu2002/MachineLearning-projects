⚡ Exploratory Data Analysis on Lightning Strikes Dataset
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to lightning strike occurrences. The goal is to understand patterns, anomalies, and potential insights about lightning behavior across time and locations.

📌 Objective
Perform an in-depth EDA on the lightning strikes dataset.

Identify trends, geographical patterns, and seasonal variations.

Visualize strike density and intensity to uncover interesting phenomena.

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes information about:

Date and Time of lightning strikes

Geographic coordinates (Latitude, Longitude)

Number of strikes

Intensity (if available)

Other meteorological or environmental attributes (if present)

🔍 Key EDA Steps
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing or inconsistent data.

Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns.

Univariate Analysis:

Distribution of strike counts.

Most frequent strike regions.

Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:

Strike frequency by month/year.

Correlation between strike intensity and location.

Time-series trends (if timestamp available).

Geospatial Analysis:

Heatmaps of lightning strike density.

Mapping strike locations using tools like folium or plotly.

📊 Visualizations
Histograms and Boxplots

Line and Bar charts for time trends

Geographic heatmaps and scatter plots

Correlation matrix (if applicable)
