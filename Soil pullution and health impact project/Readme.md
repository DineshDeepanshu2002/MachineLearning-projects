Soil Pollution and Health Impact Analysis
This project explores the impact of soil pollution on human health using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python. The notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and preliminary machine learning modeling to uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset.

üìÅ Project Structure
soil-pollution-and-health-impact-analysis.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, visualizations, and modeling steps.

data/: Folder containing raw and processed datasets (not included in this repo).

README.md: Project documentation (this file).

üìä Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical summaries and visualizations of key variables.

Correlation Analysis: Relationship between soil pollutants and health indicators.

Modeling: Preliminary classification/regression modeling to predict health outcomes based on pollution metrics.

Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn plots to understand trends and patterns.
